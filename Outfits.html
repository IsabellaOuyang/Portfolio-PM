      <h2>About the Out-Fits Project</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><p><strong>Type:</strong> Solo iteration on a paired academic project</li>
        <li><p><strong>Role:</strong> Product Designer & Manager</li>
        <li><p><strong>Timeline:</strong> 1 month (2019, 2023)</li>
        <li><p><strong>Tools Used:</strong> Figma, User Survey, Tableau, Excel, Data visualization, Adobe Illustrator, Iterations, Publication, Feedback Collection</li>
        <li><p><strong>Objective:</strong> To empower students to find confidence in their daily outfits by creating a platform that blends psychological insights, peer style trends, and personalized recommendations.</li>
        <li><p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> Architectural students wear black; engineers wear shirts. These stereotypes influence our perception of individuals and foster an innate desire for connection and belonging.
        The challenge was to address the deeper psychological needs behind students’ outfit choices and streamline their daily decision-making process.</li>
        <li><p><strong>Key Insight:</strong> Inspired by my academic research on the relationship between students’ academic majors and their outfit choices, I realized the potential to evolve the original Out-Fits concept into a more interactive and data-driven product.

      <h3>Market Need</h3>
      <p>
        Today's students are under immense pressure to balance academics, social expectations, and personal expression. Clothing is a key part of self-identity and social belonging, yet many students struggle with:
        <ul>
          <li><p><strong>Decision Fatigue:</strong> Spending excessive time choosing outfits daily, reducing their focus on academics and other priorities.</li>
          <li><p><strong>Stereotypes and Peer Pressure:</strong> Navigating style norms influenced by their academic environment, leading to a lack of confidence in personal choices.</li>
          <li><p><strong>Lack of Tools:</strong> Few existing tools address the intersection of personalization, peer trends, and decision efficiency for outfit selection.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Out-Fits addresses this gap by combining data insights and interactive features to help students make confident style choices effortlessly.
      </p>
      <br>

      </ul>
      </p>
      <br>

        <h3>Product Evolution</h3>
        <p>Initial Iteration:</p>
          <ul>
          <li><p>Created during an academic project, the first version of Out-Fits used Tableau-based data visualizations to explore trends in outfit selection among CMU students.</li>
          <li><p>Surveys revealed that students value simplicity in morning routines and prefer dressing similarly to their peers.</li>
          <li><p>Feedback indicated a demand for mobile-first solutions that integrated outfit recommendations with peer style trends.</li>
          </ul>
        <p>Decision to Redesign</p>
          <ul>
            <li><p>While the initial version provided valuable insights, its static data visualizations lacked interactivity.
              Inspired by data storytelling and the scalability of personalized product experiences, I redesigned Out-Fits into a dynamic, user-centric mobile application.</li>
