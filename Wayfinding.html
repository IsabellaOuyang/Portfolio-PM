      <h2>About the Project</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><p><strong>Type:</strong> Solo research</li>
        <li><p><strong>Role:</strong> Designer and Research</li>
        <li><p><strong>Timeline:</strong> 1 month (2024)</li>
        <li><p><strong>Tools Used:</strong> Revit, Construction Photos, Online Research, Case Studies, Product Design, AI photo</li>
        <li><p><strong>Objective:</strong> To empower patients and healthcare staff to find their ways effectively in healthcare facilities.</li>
        <li><p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> Patients frequently reported feeling lost and frustrated while navigating the facility, causing missed appointments and additional stress. Staff faced repeated inquiries for directions, impacting their productivity.
          The existing wayfinding system lacked clarity and failed to address user needs effectively.</li>
        <li><p><strong>Key Insight:</strong> Inspired by my role as an architectural designer in healthcare, I deeply resonate with patients and visitors' frustrations when visiting large healthcare facilities. Recognizing this need, I have devoted myself to researching and developing a comprehensive wayfinding solution aimed at guiding parents and visitors, starting from compact clinical spaces.

      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        Large healthcare facilities can be overwhelming for patients and visitors, leading to confusion, stress, and delays.
        This project focused on improving wayfinding systems to create a seamless navigation experience for patients, staff, and visitors.
      </p>
      <br>

      <h3>Problem</h3>
      <p>
        Patients frequently reported feeling lost and frustrated while navigating the facility, causing missed appointments and additional stress.
        Staff faced repeated inquiries for directions, impacting their productivity.
        The existing wayfinding system lacked clarity and failed to address user needs effectively.
      </p>
      <br>

      <h3>Solution</h3>
      <p>
      I led a user-centered redesign of the wayfinding system, leveraging data from patient journeys, staff workflows, and environmental constraints. The solution included:
      <ul>
        <li><p><strong>Simplified Signage:</strong> Designed clear, intuitive signage that incorporated universal healthcare symbols.
        <li><p><strong>Digital Integration:</strong> Proposed a mobile-friendly app with GPS functionality to guide patients in real-time.
        <li><p><strong>Staff Training:</strong> Introduced staff protocols to align with the new wayfinding system for consistent support.
      </ul>
      </p>
      <br>

      <div class="project-image">
        <h3>Process</h3>
        <p>1. User Research:</p>
          <ul>
          <li><p>Conducted interviews and surveys with patients and staff to identify pain points and priorities.</li>
          <li><p>Mapped common patient journeys and bottlenecks using journey mapping and flow diagrams.</li>
          </ul>
        <p>2. (Next Step) Data-Driven Insights:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><p>To analyze appointment data to understand high-traffic zones and peak navigation issues.</li>
            <li><p>To use this data to prioritize signage placement and app features.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>3. (Next Step) Prototyping & Testing:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><p>To develop low-fidelity prototypes of the signage and app interface.</li>
              <li><p>To iterate designs based on usability testing with patients, refining visuals and language for maximum clarity.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>4. (Next Step) Implementation:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><p>To collaborate with facility managers to deploy the signage system in key areas.</li>
                <li><p>To design training modules for staff to support patients using the wayfinding app.</li>
              </ul>

        <h3>Challenges & Solutions</h3>
        <p>1. Engagement and Scalability</p>
          <ul>
          <li><p>Challenge: It would be hard to find the balance between personal engagement and scalable content.</li>
          <li><p>Solution: By incorporating generalized archetypes and visual infographics, we could ensure each user would feel represented while minimizing the need for excessive customization.</li>
          </ul>
        <p>2. User Retention</p>
          <ul>
            <li><p>Challenge: It might be challenging to maintain and increase user retention in a style-based app.</li>
            <li><p>Solution: Implemented Nir Eyal’s "Hooked" framework, gradually personalizing profiles and rewarding small commitments with tailored notifications.</li>
          </ul>

      <div class="project-goals">
        <h3>Project Goals</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><p><strong>To Reduce 30% in Navigation Time:</strong> Expecting patients to report faster and less stressful navigation, leading to improved appointment punctuality.</li>
                <li><p><strong>To Increase Staff Efficiency:</strong> Expecting staff to spend 40% less time assisting with directions, allowing them to focus on core responsibilities.</li>
                <li><p><strong>To Gain Positive Patient Feedback:</strong> Expecting 85% of future surveyed patients to feel more confident navigating the facility with the updated wayfinding system.</li>
              </ul>
      </div>
