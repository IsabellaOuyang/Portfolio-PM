      <h3>Market Need</h3>
      <p>
        Transitioning from college to the workplace presents a significant challenge for students, with communication skills being one of the most cited deficiencies by employers.
        Research shows that while 80% of employers value oral and written communication as critical competencies, fewer than 40% of recent graduates are proficient in these areas.
        Traditional education systems often fail to integrate real-world communication training, leaving students ill-prepared for workplace interactions.
        <br><br>
        Additionally, students aged 17–24 spend 8–10 hours daily on mobile devices, signaling a clear opportunity to engage them through an accessible, technology-driven solution.
      </p>
      <br>

      <h3>Value Proposition</h3>
      <p>
        CommUnity is a mobile-first platform that equips college students with the skills they need to communicate confidently and effectively in the U.S. workplace.
        Through scenario-based learning, interactive activities, AI-driven feedback, peer collaboration, and networking opportunities developed based on learning sciences and theories, CommUnity bridges the gap between academic knowledge and real-world application.</p>
      <br>

      <h3>Target Audience</h3>
      <p>
        Primarily targeting non-native College students aged 17–24, preparing for internships or full-time roles in the U.S. workplace who are seeking to improve oral, written, and interpersonal communication skills.
        <br>
        <br>The platform also appeals to native students aiming to improve their communication skills, as well as career services and academic institutions looking to integrate a scalable communication training tool.

        <h3>Potential Outcome to Track</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><p><strong>Confidence in Workplace Communication: </strong>Measure user-reported confidence levels before and after completing key modules, aiming for at least a 70% improvement in self-assessed communication skills.</li>
          <li><p><strong>Lesson Completion Rates: </strong>Track engagement metrics, such as the percentage of users completing role-play scenarios and interactive exercises, with a goal of maintaining a 75% completion rate.</li>
          <li><p><strong>Networking Engagement: </strong>Monitor the number of students participating in networking activities, such as virtual coffee chats, mentorship sessions, and mock interviews. Aim for 50% of active users engaging in at least one networking feature per month.</li>
          <li><p><strong>Peer Collaboration Impact: </strong>FAnalyze the effectiveness of group evaluations and social forums by tracking the frequency of user interactions and their perceived value. Target a 30% increase in collaboration over the first six months post-launch.</li>
          <li><p><strong>Scalability Metrics: </strong>Evaluate the adaptability of the curriculum across different academic institutions and industries by tracking the adoption rate and gathering institution-specific feedback.</li>
          <li><p><strong>Retention and Return Rates: </strong>Measure user retention over 3, 6, and 12 months, aiming for a 60% monthly active user rate. Track how often users return to refresh skills or engage with new modules.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>Through CommUnity, I demonstrated the ability to design scalable, user-centric solutions that address real-world challenges.
          By integrating research, iterative design, technological innovation, and networking opportunities, this project showcases my ability to bridge gaps between education and workplace readiness.
